Difib is literally Bifid Cipher backwards so that's a big hint

I started doing this in Java (e.g. Difib.java) but then realized that it was much easier to do it in Python so I found the keys in Java (basically removing anything that's not alphabetical from the rambles and making sure they are 26 characters) and decoded it using Bifid.

I ended up getting "ust some unnecessary te t that holds absolutely no meaning whatsoever and bears no significance to you in any way" so I filled in the x's and j's to get "just some unnecessary text that holds absolutely no meaning whatsoever and bears no significance to you in any way"

Just nc that and get the flag
